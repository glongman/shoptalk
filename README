== ShopTalk Demo Application

ShopTalk is a demonstration mashup app that melds the VOIP services of CloudVox (http://cloudvox.com) and the APIs provided by Shopify (http://shopify.com) for 3rd Party app development.

In a nutshell a Shopify customer, a shop owner, can add the ShopTalk application to their shop and gain the ability to phone into that shop from a land line. In the current incarnation the caller, after identifying using an access code, is able to access the running total for orders placed in the shop that day.

== Trying it out

The procedure for trying out this code yourself involves creating both a free CloudVox account and a Shopify developer API account. The application must be publicly available to work and I've include instructions for hosting the app on Heroku (http://heroku.com). Using Heroku is the easiest I've found to get up and running quickly. References to Cloudvox, Shopify, and Heroku documentation are provided at the end of this document.

1. Sign up for a free CloudVox account and create a cloudvox application

   - http://cloudvox.com/signup
   - after signup create an application (mine is called ShopTalk) and make note of the application phone # and extension
   - To make free calls to your application you need to set up a Sip phone that talks to your Cloudvox account
   - I used X-Lite 4 (beta) available here: http://help.cloudvox.com/faqs/sip-phones/x-lite

2. Sign up as a Shopify developer (also free)

	- http://shopify.com/developers
	- create a Shopify applicaiton (mine was amazingly called ShopTalk)
	- make note of the API key and secret

3. Get the code for this app

   - fork this project on GitHub
   - clone it into your local environment

4. Sign up for a free Heroku account

   - http://heroku.com/signup
   - get the Heroku gem
       > sudo gem install heroku
   - create the app using the gem
   - deploy the app using the gem
   - migrate
   - set env vars (Shopify API key and secret + Cloudvox app)
   - make note of the hostname Heroku assigned to your application

5. Configure your Shopify app 

   - add the callback url to your application running on Heroku

6. Configure your Cloudvox application

   - When calls arrive a call plan is loaded from your application via an HTTP GET
   - enter the url to your application on Heroku. like this...

7. Create a Test Store in Shopify and add your ShopTalk application to it

   - make note of the access code that is displayed on the ShopTalk homepage after installation
   - add some orders to your test store.

8. Call!

   - Dial the phone number of your Cloudvox application using your Sip phone
   - When prompted, enter the access code you wrote down in step 7

   - Listen as the app reads to you information about orders created today.
